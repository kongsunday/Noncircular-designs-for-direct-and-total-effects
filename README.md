# Noncircular-designs-for-direct-and-total-effects
This code provide a searching algorithm for optimal designs under noncircular setup for interference and crossover models.
It demands IBM optimizer "Gurobi" for integer programming, which can be replaced via other optimizer and extra appropriate coding.
This files serve as supplementary materials for the following paper:
"Noncircular designs for interference models with border effects: Gain with no pain"
